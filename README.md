# Location-Twitter-Data-
A code for collating twitter data over time - currently still a work in progress

Create a seperate R file named "Twitter_Keys"

Write the code below to authenticate via web browser - find credentials in Twitter

token <- create_token(
  app = "App Name Here",
  consumer_key = "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  consumer_secret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  access_token = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  access_secret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx")
  
  Save the file, and close it, then run the code.
